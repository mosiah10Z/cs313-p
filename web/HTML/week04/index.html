        <br> I changed the size of the image on the first page. It was too big and it was taking over the whole page somewhat. In order to make the page look more seamless, I decreased its size and aligned it to the width of the paragraphs.
        <br>
        <br> I also decided to make changes to the second page. I originally would have liked it to be somwhwat similar to the home page. For the purpose of fulfilling the requirement of creating inline styles, I had to create a few unique characteristics. For this week I will create a margin on the text "About the developer". I will change up the style of the headings but keep the tomato color because I think it works with the rest of my color palette for the page. I will remove the "Tennis NUT" part and change the color of the text as I see fit, in order to make everything unified. As a result of the changes, I think the page reads better. I identified some spacing problems that were present and rectified it in order to make the page flow better from one division to another.

        <br> Having had some experience in typography, my main focus last week was to make sure the typography works for the whole website . I feel like I was able to accomplish that, by making use of the leading, hierarchy, alignment and grouping. I made minor changes to the second page to make it more unified with the home page. Removing the background color for the heading allowed the heading and the paragraph content to work together. Aligning the subscribe heading to the left unifies it with the "about the developer" text.

        <br> I was trying to figure out a way to let the user know which page he is in within the website. Instead of making a side bar as a local navigation tool, I decided to highlight the page the user was in, on the horizontal navigation bar. This makes navigation more intuitive.
